# tidy 文本格式 {#tidytext}

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE)
options(width = 100, dplyr.width = 100)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_light())
```

处理数据的 tidy 数据原则简单有效，用于文本也一样。按 Hadley Wickham [@tidydata] 的阐述，tidy 数据有如下特定的结构：

* 每个 variable 一列
* 每个 observation 一行
* 每种 observational unit 一个表格

于是，我们不妨定义 tidy 文本格式为一个 **每行一个符号的表格**。一个符号（token）是文本的一个有意义的单元，比如我们在分析中经常使用的词，而符号化（tokenization）就是将文本切分为符号的过程。这种“每行一个符号”的结构与当下分析中常用的其它文本存储方式形成鲜明对比，如字符串或者文档-术语矩阵。用于 tidy 文本挖掘时，存储在每行的 **符号** 通常是单个词，但也可以是 n元语（n-gram）、句或段落。在 tidytext 包里提供了符号化（tokenize）这些常见单元的方法，将其转换至“每项一行”的格式。

Tidy 数据集可以使用一组标准的 “tidy” 工具进行操作，包括了流行的包如 dplyr [@R-dplyr]、tidyr [@R-tidyr]、ggplot2 [@R-ggplot2] 和 broom [@R-broom]。若能保持输入和输出均为 tidy 表格，用户可以在这些包之间自如转换。我们发现这些 tidy 工具可以自然地拓展到很多文本分析和探索活动中。

与此同时，tidytext 包并不强制用户在一次分析中全程保持文本数据为 tidy 形式，而是包含了 `tidy()` 多种对象的函数（见 broom 包），可以来自流行的文本挖掘 R 包，如 tm [@tm] 和 quanteda [@R-quanteda]。这使得类似如下的工作流成为可能：使用 dplyr 和其它 tidy 工具对数据进行导入、过滤和处理，之后转换为文档-术语矩阵进行机器学习，所得到的模型可以再被转换回 tidy 形式供解读并由 ggplot2 视觉化。

## tidy 文本与其它数据结构的对比

如前所述，我们定义 tidy 文本格式为一个表格，**每行一个符号**。以这种方式结构化的文本数据遵循 tidy 数据原则，可以用统一一致的工具进行操作。这值得和文本挖掘方法中常用的其它存储文本的格式进行对比。

* **字符串**：文本当然可以用字符串存储，也就是 R 中的字符向量，这种形式的文本数据一般会先读进内存。
* **语料**：这些种类的典型对象包含了原始的字符串，并带有额外的元数据和细节标注等。
* **文档-术语矩阵**：这是一个稀疏矩阵，描述了文档的一个集合（即一组语料），每个文档一行，每个术语一列。矩阵中的典型数据为词的个数或 tf-idf（见章 \@ref(tfidf)）。

咱们先暂时不去探索语料和文档-术语矩阵对象，章 \@ref(dtm) 将会讲到这些。从将文本转换成 tidy 格式的基础开始。

## `unnest_tokens` 函数

英文原著使用了Emily Dickinson的一首小诗，这里选取李白的《静夜思》作为中文的例子。

```{r text}
text <- c("床前明月光，",
          "疑是地上霜。",
          "举头望明月，",
          "低头思故乡。")

text
```

中文一般不用空格隔开词，所以需要完成分词的步骤（结果并不完全准确）。这里选择 [jiebaR](https://github.com/qinwf/jiebaR) [@R-jiebaR]，内置了多种分词方式并直接支持停止词等。

```{r text_wb, dependson = "text"}
library(jiebaR)
cutter <- worker(bylines = TRUE, symbol = TRUE)
text_wb <- sapply(segment(text, cutter), function(x){
  paste(x, collapse = " ")})

text_wb
```

This is a typical character vector that we might want to analyze. In order to turn it into a tidy text dataset, we first need to put it into a data frame.

```{r text_df, dependson = "text_wb"}
library(dplyr)
text_df <- data_frame(line = 1:4, text = text_wb)

text_df
```

What does it mean that this data frame has printed out as a "tibble"? A tibble is a modern class of data frame within R, available in the dplyr and tibble packages, that has a convenient print method, will not convert strings to factors, and does not use row names. Tibbles are great for use with tidy tools.

Notice that this data frame containing text isn't yet compatible with tidy text analysis, though. We can't filter out words or count which occur most frequently, since each row is made up of multiple combined words. We need to convert this so that it has **one-token-per-document-per-row**. 

```{block, type = "rmdnote"}
A token is a meaningful unit of text, most often a word, that we are interested in using for further analysis, and tokenization is the process of splitting text into tokens. 
```

In this first example, we only have one document (the poem), but we will explore examples with multiple documents soon.

Within our tidy text framework, we need to both break the text into individual tokens (a process called *tokenization*) *and* transform it to a tidy data structure. To do this, we use tidytext's `unnest_tokens()` function. 特意为中文用户解释一下词源，un-nest即nest的反向操作，把东西从nest里取出来。

```{r dependson = "text_df", R.options = list(dplyr.print_max = 10)}
library(tidytext)

text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

The two basic arguments to `unnest_tokens` used here are column names. First we have the output column name that will be created as the text is unnested into it (`word`, in this case), and then the input column that the text comes from (`text`, in this case). Remember that `text_df` above has a column called `text` that contains the data of interest.

After using `unnest_tokens`, we've split each row so that there is one token (word) in each row of the new data frame; the default tokenization in `unnest_tokens()` is for single words, as shown here. Also notice:

* Other columns, such as the line number each word came from, are retained.
* Punctuation has been stripped.
* By default, `unnest_tokens()` converts the tokens to lowercase, which makes them easier to compare or combine with other datasets. (Use the `to_lower = FALSE` argument to turn off this behavior).

Having the text data in this format lets us manipulate, process, and visualize the text using the standard set of tidy tools, namely dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tidyflow-ch1).

```{r tidyflow-ch1, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "A flowchart of a typical text analysis using tidy data principles. This chapter shows how to summarize and visualize text using these tools."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyflow-ch-1.png")
```

## Tidying the great works {#tidyworks}

英文世界可以使用 Jane Austen 的六部完整已发表小说 [janeaustenr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=janeaustenr) R包 [@R-janeaustenr]，并转换为 tidy 格式。中文暂时缺少此类数据，我们可以从《红楼梦》的部分文本开始。

```{r great_works}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

great_works <- data_frame(text = readLines("data/hongloumeng/001.txt"), chapter = "第一回") %>%
  mutate(linenumber = row_number(), chapter = 1)

great_works
```

移除过于常见的停止词并分词。

```{r tidy_works, dependson = "great_works"}
library(jiebaR)
library(tidytext)

cutter <- worker(bylines = TRUE, symbol = TRUE, stop_word = "data/stop_word_zh.utf8")
great_works$text <- sapply(segment(great_works$text, cutter), function(x){paste(x, collapse = " ")})
tidy_works <- great_works %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

tidy_works
```

按词频进行排序。

```{r dependson = "tidy_works"}
tidy_works %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

用图 \@ref(fig:plotcount-zh) 展示常见词词频。由于使用文本较少，词汇量并不大。这里尝试使用 [showtext](https://github.com/yixuan/showtext) [@R-showtext] 方便图片里的中文字符正确渲染而无需依赖系统字体。[文泉驿微米黑](https://wenq.org/wqy2/index.cgi?MicroHei)是自由字体，遵循[GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)，允许所有人复制和发布。

```{r plotcount-zh, dependson = "tidy_works", fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.cap="《红楼梦》第一回常见词"}
library(showtext)
showtext_auto(enable = TRUE)
font_add("WenQuanYi Micro Hei", "data/wqy-microhei.ttc")

myplot <- tidy_works %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 20) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "WenQuanYi Micro Hei"))
print(myplot)
```

The janeaustenr package provides these texts in a one-row-per-line format, where a line is this context is analogous to a literal printed line in a physical book. Let’s start with that, and also use `mutate()` to annotate a `linenumber` quantity to keep track of lines in the original format and a `chapter` (using a regex) to find where all the chapters are.

```{r original_books}
library(janeaustenr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

original_books <- austen_books() %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  mutate(linenumber = row_number(),
         chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("^chapter [\\divxlc]",
                                                 ignore_case = TRUE)))) %>%
  ungroup()

original_books
```

To work with this as a tidy dataset, we need to restructure it in the **one-token-per-row** format, which as we saw earlier is done with the `unnest_tokens()` function.

```{r tidy_books_raw, dependson = "original_books"}
library(tidytext)
tidy_books <- original_books %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

tidy_books
```

This function uses the [tokenizers](https://github.com/ropensci/tokenizers) package to separate each line of text in the original data frame into tokens. The default tokenizing is for words, but other options include characters, n-grams, sentences, lines, paragraphs, or separation around a regex pattern.

Now that the data is in one-word-per-row format, we can manipulate it with tidy tools like dplyr. Often in text analysis, we will want to remove stop words; stop words are words that are not useful for an analysis, typically extremely common words such as "the", "of", "to", and so forth in English. We can remove stop words (kept in the tidytext dataset `stop_words`) with an `anti_join()`.

```{r tidy_books, dependson = "tidy_books_raw"}
data(stop_words)

tidy_books <- tidy_books %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)
```

The `stop_words` dataset in the tidytext package contains stop words from three lexicons. We can use them all together, as we have here, or `filter()` to only use one set of stop words if that is more appropriate for a certain analysis.

We can also use dplyr's `count()` to find the most common words in all the books as a whole.

```{r dependson = "tidy_books"}
tidy_books %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) 
```

Because we've been using tidy tools, our word counts are stored in a tidy data frame. This allows us to pipe this directly to the ggplot2 package, for example to create a visualization of the most common words (Figure \@ref(fig:plotcount)).

```{r plotcount, dependson = "tidy_books", fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.cap="The most common words in Jane Austen's novels"}

tidy_books %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 600) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip()
```

Note that the `austen_books()` function started us with exactly the text we wanted to analyze, but in other cases we may need to perform cleaning of text data, such as removing copyright headers or formatting. You'll see examples of this kind of pre-processing in the case study chapters, particularly Chapter \@ref(pre-processing-text). 

## The gutenbergr package

Now that we've used the janeaustenr package to explore tidying text, let's introduce the [gutenbergr](https://github.com/ropensci/gutenbergr) package [@R-gutenbergr]. The gutenbergr package provides access to the public domain works from the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) collection. The package includes tools both for downloading books (stripping out the unhelpful header/footer information), and a complete dataset of Project Gutenberg metadata that can be used to find works of interest. In this book, we will mostly use the function `gutenberg_download()` that downloads one or more works from Project Gutenberg by ID, but you can also use other functions to explore metadata, pair Gutenberg ID with title, author, language, etc., or gather information about authors. 


```{block, type = "rmdtip"}
To learn more about gutenbergr, check out the [package's tutorial at rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/tutorials/gutenbergr_tutorial.html), where it is one of rOpenSci's packages for data access.

## Word frequencies

A common task in text mining is to look at word frequencies, just like we have done above for Jane Austen's novels, and to compare frequencies across different texts. We can do this intuitively and smoothly using tidy data principles. We already have Jane Austen's works; let's get two more sets of texts to compare to. First, let's look at some science fiction and fantasy novels by H.G. Wells, who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Let's get [*The Time Machine*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35), [*The War of the Worlds*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36), [*The Invisible Man*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5230), and [*The Island of Doctor Moreau*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/159). We can access these works using `gutenberg_download()` and the Project Gutenberg ID numbers for each novel.

中文我们可以使用冯梦龙的《三言》和袁枚《子不语》《续子不语》分别与《红楼梦》进行比较。冯梦龙[明]时间较早，而曹雪芹[清]与袁枚[清]处于同一时代，但题材上《红楼梦》与《三言》更为接近。这些作品间的相似程度将如何呢？

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(gutenbergr)

hongloumeng <- gutenberg_download(24264)
sanyan <- gutenberg_download(c(24141, 24239, 27582))
zibuyu <- gutenberg_download(c(25245, 25315))
```

这次我们使用《红楼梦》的全文。

```{r hongloumeng, echo = FALSE}
load("data/hongloumeng.rda")
```

```{r tidy_hongloumeng, dependson = "hongloumeng"}
library(jiebaR)

cutter <- worker(bylines = TRUE, stop_word = "data/stop_word_zh.utf8")
hongloumeng$text <- sapply(segment(hongloumeng$text, cutter), function(x){paste(x, collapse = " ")})
tidy_hongloumeng <- hongloumeng %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

```{r dependson = "tidy_hongloumeng"}
tidy_hongloumeng %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

简单试一下，看看冯梦龙这些小说里最常用的词是什么。

```{r sanyan, echo = FALSE}
load("data/sanyan.rda")
```

```{r tidy_sanyan, dependson = "sanyan"}
library(jiebaR)

cutter <- worker(bylines = TRUE, stop_word = "data/stop_word_zh.utf8")
sanyan$text <- sapply(segment(sanyan$text, cutter), function(x){paste(x, collapse = " ")})
tidy_sanyan <- sanyan %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

```{r dependson = "tidy_sanyan"}
tidy_sanyan %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

《子不语》两部依样处理。

```{r zibuyu, echo = FALSE}
load("data/zibuyu.rda")
```

```{r tidy_zibuyu, dependson = "zibuyu"}
library(jiebaR)

cutter <- worker(bylines = TRUE, stop_word = "data/stop_word_zh.utf8")
zibuyu$text <- sapply(segment(zibuyu$text, cutter), function(x){paste(x, collapse = " ")})
tidy_zibuyu <- zibuyu %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

```{r dependson = "tidy_zibuyu"}
tidy_zibuyu %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

看起来“人”在所有作品里都是最常见的。

Now, let's calculate the frequency for each word for the works of Jane Austen, the Brontë sisters, and H.G. Wells by binding the data frames together. We can use `spread` and `gather` from tidyr to reshape our dataframe so that it is just what we need for plotting and comparing the three sets of novels.

```{r frequency, dependson = c("tidy_hongloumeng", "tidy_sanyan", "tidy_zibuyu")}
library(tidyr)

frequency <- bind_rows(mutate(tidy_zibuyu, author = "袁枚"),
                       mutate(tidy_sanyan, author = "冯梦龙"),
                       mutate(tidy_hongloumeng, author = "Cao")) %>%
  count(author, word) %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  select(-n) %>% 
  spread(author, proportion) %>% 
  gather(author, proportion, `袁枚`:`冯梦龙`)
```

We use `str_extract()` here because the UTF-8 encoded texts from Project Gutenberg have some examples of words with underscores around them to indicate emphasis (like italics). The tokenizer treated these as words, but we don't want to count "\_any\_" separately from "any" as we saw in our initial data exploration before choosing to use `str_extract()`. 

Now let's plot (Figure \@ref(fig:plotcompare)).

```{r plotcompare, dependson = "frequency", fig.width=10, fig.height=5.5, fig.cap="比较曹雪芹、冯梦龙与袁枚作品的词频"}
library(scales)

# expect a warning about rows with missing values being removed
ggplot(frequency, aes(x = proportion, y = `Cao`, color = abs(`Cao` - proportion))) +
  geom_abline(color = "gray40", lty = 2) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, size = 2.5, width = 0.3, height = 0.3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = word), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1.5, family = "WenQuanYi Micro Hei") +
  scale_x_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_color_gradient(limits = c(0, 0.001), low = "darkslategray4", high = "gray75") +
  facet_wrap(~author, ncol = 2) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(y = "曹雪芹", x = NULL) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "WenQuanYi Micro Hei"))
```

Words that are close to the line in these plots have similar frequencies in both sets of texts, for example, in both Austen and Brontë texts ("miss", "time", "day" at the upper frequency end) or in both Austen and Wells texts ("time", "day", "brother" at the high frequency end). Words that are far from the line are words that are found more in one set of texts than another. For example, in the Austen-Brontë panel, words like "elizabeth", "emma", and "fanny" (all proper nouns) are found in Austen's texts but not much in the Brontë texts, while words like "arthur" and "dog" are found in the Brontë texts but not the Austen texts. In comparing H.G. Wells with Jane Austen, Wells uses words like "beast", "guns", "feet", and "black" that Austen does not, while Austen uses words like "family", "friend", "letter", and "dear" that Wells does not.

Overall, notice in Figure \@ref(fig:plotcompare) that the words in the Austen-Brontë panel are closer to the zero-slope line than in the Austen-Wells panel. Also notice that the words extend to lower frequencies in the Austen-Brontë panel; there is empty space in the Austen-Wells panel at low frequency. These characteristics indicate that Austen and the Brontë sisters use more similar words than Austen and H.G. Wells. Also, we see that not all the words are found in all three sets of texts and there are fewer data points in the panel for Austen and H.G. Wells.

Let's quantify how similar and different these sets of word frequencies are using a correlation test. How correlated are the word frequencies between Austen and the Brontë sisters, and between Austen and Wells?

```{r cor_test, dependson = "frequency"}
cor.test(data = frequency[frequency$author == "冯梦龙",],
         ~ proportion + `Cao`)
cor.test(data = frequency[frequency$author == "袁枚",],
         ~ proportion + `Cao`)
```

Just as we saw in the plots, the word frequencies are more correlated between the Austen and Brontë novels than between Austen and H.G. Wells.

## Summary

In this chapter, we explored what we mean by tidy data when it comes to text, and how tidy data principles can be applied to natural language processing. When text is organized in a format with one token per row, tasks like removing stop words or calculating word frequencies are natural applications of familiar operations within the tidy tool ecosystem. The one-token-per-row framework can be extended from single words to n-grams and other meaningful units of text, as well as to many other analysis priorities that we will consider in this book.
