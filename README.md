# Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach

To build PDF, run `Rscript -e 'bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", output_format = "bookdown::pdf_book")'`. Similarly, epub_book can be built.

This is a fork, by Song Li, of the repo to note a few things down and modify the book [**Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach**](http://tidytextmining.com/), by Julia Silge and David Robinson.
